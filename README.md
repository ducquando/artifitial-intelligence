Different ML and DL models that I trained for CS courses at Fulbright University Vietnam

Machine Learning models:
- [Naive Bayes](Naive%20Bayes%20Classification.ipynb): predict travel insurance buyers
- [K-means](K-means%20Clustering.ipynb): segment credit card customers
- [Decision Tree & Random Forest](Descision%20Tree%20%26%20Random%20Forest.ipynb): predict employee recruitment rate
- [Support Vector Machine](Support%20Vector%20Machine.ipynb): predict breast cancer

Deep Learning models:
- [VGG16](VGG16.ipynb): classify handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset
- [ResNet](ResNet50v2.ipynb): classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset
- [LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and 1D CNN](Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb): classify sentiment from the imdb_reviews dataset
